# Complex Project: Research & Planning Phase
**Last Update Date:** 2025-08-08  
**Phase:** Research & Discovery  
**Status:** In Progress  

---
## 2025-08-08 SIMPLIFIED GOALS - CANDIDATE-FIRST APPROACH ðŸŽ¯

**FOCUS**: Start with candidate entity only (much simpler than full marketplace)

### Today's Implementation Plan:
1. **Candidate Schema Design** - Simple candidate table with recruiter relationship
2. **Basic Navigation** - Platform admin view with candidate add/view functionality  
3. **Recruiter Assignment** - Link candidates to recruiting user (agency recruiter, platform, or employer)

### Core Data Model (Simplified):
```
Candidate:
- candidate_id (primary key)
- recruiter_user_id (foreign key to Users table) 
- basic_attributes (name, email, phone, etc.)
```

### Terminology Update:
- **"Agency Recruiter"** = user from agency partner (replaces generic "recruiter")
- **Recruiter Types**: Agency Recruiter, Platform Recruiter, Employer Recruiter

---

## DEFERRED TO LATER (Too Complex for MVP):
- Job submissions workflow
- Multi-sided marketplace features
- Complete data structure design for complex candidate data
- PostgreSQL multi-tenant configuration  
- Role hierarchy and complex access control 




---
## Project Overview
**PRODUCT VISION:** AI-powered recruiting marketplace + ATS that automates repetitive tasks and uses voice commands/agents to streamline workflows across three user personas.

**USER PERSONAS:**
1. **Recruiting Agencies (Supply Side)** - Find, manage, and submit candidates
2. **Employers (Demand Side)** - Post jobs, review candidates, manage hiring pipeline  
3. **Platform Admin (Marketplace)** - Facilitate matches, handle disputes, manage both sides

## CURRENT SCOPE - PHASE 1 MVP âš¡ DESIGNING NOW

### 1. ENTITY TERMINOLOGY ðŸŽ¯ IN PROGRESS
- **Top-Level Entities**: Candidate, Agency Recruiter, Employer, Job, Submittals, Users
- **Database Schema Design** - **PENDING - CRITICAL**
- **User Table Structure** - **PENDING - ONE vs MULTIPLE TABLES?**

### 2. CANDIDATE-FIRST IMPLEMENTATION âœ… 
- **Simple Candidate Schema** with agency_recruiter_id
- **Platform Admin View** - add/view candidates
- **Basic CRUD Operations** - start here, expand later
