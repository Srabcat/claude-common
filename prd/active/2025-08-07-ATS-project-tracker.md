# Complex Project: Research & Planning Phase
**Date:** 2025-01-08  
**Phase:** Research & Discovery  
**Status:** In Progress  

---

## Project Overview
**PRODUCT VISION:** AI-powered recruiting marketplace + ATS that automates repetitive tasks and uses voice commands/agents to streamline workflows across three user personas.

**USER PERSONAS:**
1. **Recruiting Agencies (Supply Side)** - Find, manage, and submit candidates
2. **Employers (Demand Side)** - Post jobs, review candidates, manage hiring pipeline  
3. **Platform Admin (Marketplace)** - Facilitate matches, handle disputes, manage both sides

## COMPETITIVE RESEARCH COMPLETE âœ…

### Recruiting Agency Tools Research
**Analyzed:** Bullhorn, Crelate, Invenias, Clockwork, Thrive TRM
- Table stakes features identified for candidate management and pipeline tracking
- Advanced features like email automation and CRM capabilities mapped
- Key pain points: 15+ hours/week on manual job posting, 10 hours/week on interview coordination
- AI opportunities: Voice commands, automated sourcing, smart data entry

### Employer ATS Research  
**Analyzed:** Greenhouse, Ashby
- Core hiring workflow features from job posting through offer management
- Advanced analytics and integration capabilities documented
- Major pain points: Complex navigation, scheduling nightmares, buried information
- AI opportunities: Resume screening, interview question generation, voice-powered status updates

### Marketplace Platform Research
**Analyzed:** Bounty Jobs, Paraform, Hired.com/LHH
- Platform administration and two-sided marketplace management
- Quality control, dispute resolution, and payment processing workflows
- Admin pain points: 13 hours/week candidate screening, manual dispute resolution
- AI opportunities: Proactive issue detection, automated compliance monitoring

## Research Framework

### Competitive Analysis Template
**For each competitor, we'll analyze:**
- Product overview and positioning
- Core features and functionality
- Pricing model and tiers
- Target audience and use cases
- Strengths and differentiators
- Weaknesses and gaps
- User feedback and reviews
- Market traction/funding

### Feature Prioritization Framework
**We'll use a scoring matrix considering:**
- User value/impact (1-10)
- Technical complexity (1-10)
- Competitive necessity (1-10)
- Business value (1-10)
- Resource requirements (1-10)

### MVP Definition Criteria
**Features must meet:**
