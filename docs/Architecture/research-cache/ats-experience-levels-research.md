## LinkedIn's Standard (Most Battle-Tested):

**Complete dropdown list with 7 options:**
1. **Internship**
2. **Entry Level** - 0-2 years, focus on learning company operations
3. **Associate** - 2-5 years, established mid-level contributor  
4. **Mid-Senior Level** - 5-10 years, manages others while reporting up
5. **Director** - Drives strategy for business unit/function
6. **Executive** - Sets company-wide vision and priorities
7. **Not applicable** - For roles where levels don't apply (board, volunteer, freelance)

## LinkedIn Level Definitions (from industry sources):

**Entry Level**: 
- 0 to 2 years experience, with appropriate degree
- Lowest form of seniority, just starting out in field/company
- Focus on gaining expertise and learning company operations

**Associate**: 
- 2+ to 5+ years relevant experience
- Entry-level or mid-level position requiring 2-3 years experience

**Mid-Senior Level**: 
- Generally 5-10 years experience
- Independent and confident in delivering complex work
- Managerial position over entry-level while reporting to higher seniority
- Sometimes "mid-senior" indicates seniority over other middle management

**Director**: 
- Proficiency in leading teams and developing strategy
- Strong technical knowledge of managed areas
- Drives strategy for business unit or function

**Executive**: 
- High level of experience, knowledge and responsibility
- Most decision-making power at company
- Provides leadership and guidance to less senior employees
- Sets company-wide vision and priorities

**Important Note**: LinkedIn states "There are no 'industry standard' or LinkedIn specified definitions to map position levels to years of experience. It is something that each company determines based on their compensation plan and human resource system."
