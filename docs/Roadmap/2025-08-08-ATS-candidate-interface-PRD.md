# ATS Candidate Interface - Product Requirements Document
**Date:** 2025-08-08  
**Version:** 1.0  
**Status:** Ready for Development  
**Team:** Frontend Engineering  

---

## EXECUTIVE SUMMARY

Build a world-class candidate management interface that exceeds industry standards (Paraform, Greenhouse, Ashby). Focus on candidate-first implementation with platform admin capabilities, role switching for testing, and superior UX through modern design patterns.

**Primary Goal:** Create the first feature of our ATS platform - candidate management for platform administrators with add/view/edit capabilities.

---

## PRODUCT OVERVIEW

### Problem Statement
Current ATS platforms have poor navigation (5-7 clicks to find information), cluttered interfaces, and slow performance. Users struggle with information archaeology and inefficient workflows.

### Solution
A modern, fast, intuitive candidate interface with:
- Instant search and smart filtering
- Role-based navigation with testing capabilities  
- Smooth animations and micro-interactions
- Keyboard shortcuts for power users
- Mobile-first responsive design

### Success Metrics
- **Performance**: Page load < 1 second, search results < 200ms
- **Usability**: Users can find any candidate in < 3 clicks
- **Accessibility**: WCAG 2.1 AA compliance
- **Mobile**: Full feature parity on all screen sizes

---

## TECHNICAL SPECIFICATIONS

### Technology Stack
- **Framework:** Next.js 14 (App Router), TypeScript
- **UI Components:** shadcn/ui + Tailwind CSS
- **State Management:** Zustand

## USER PERSONAS & ACCESS CONTROL

### Primary User: Platform Admin
**Access Level:** Full access to all organizations and candidates
- Can view/add/edit candidates across all agencies and employers
