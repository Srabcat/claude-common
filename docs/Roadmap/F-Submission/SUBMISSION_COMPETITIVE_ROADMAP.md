## Based on Competitor Analysis Research

**Reference**: Full competitor analysis in `/docs/Roadmap/Reference/Competitors/`

## How Competitors Handle Submissions

### Multi-Party Submission Models

#### BountyJobs (14,000+ Recruiter Network)
**Key Features:**
- **Agency Submission Flow**: Agency submits candidate to employer job
- **Performance-Based Selection**: Employers choose agencies based on data
- **Single Contract Model**: One contract covers multiple agencies
- **Automated Fee Management**: Platform handles invoicing and distribution

**Technical Implementation:**
```sql
-- BountyJobs-style schema
CREATE TABLE job_agency_invitations (
  job_id UUID REFERENCES jobs(id),
  agency_id UUID REFERENCES organizations(id),
  invitation_status ENUM('invited', 'accepted', 'declined'),
  performance_score INTEGER, -- historical success rate
  fee_percentage DECIMAL(5,2),
  contract_terms JSONB
);
```

#### RecruiterFlow (Agency-Focused)
**Key Features:**
- **Client Approval Workflow**: Agency gets approval before submission
- **Multiple Client Submissions**: Same candidate to different clients
- **Branded Client Portals**: Custom interfaces for each client
- **Submission Performance Tracking**: Success rates per agency-client pair

#### Paraform (Elite Network)
**Key Features:**
- **Pre-vetted Submissions**: Only elite recruiters can submit
- **70% Interview Rate**: Quality over quantity approach
- **Business Process Management**: Platform handles client communication
- **Streamlined Collaboration**: Warm introductions vs cold applications

### Our Competitive Advantage Opportunity

**Gap in Market**: No platform optimizes for **agency-employer partnership** vs marketplace model

## Phase 1: Core Submission Architecture (Based on Existing Schema)

### Enhance Existing Schema (From candidate-submissions-schema.md)
```sql
-- Extend the existing submissions table with competitive features
ALTER TABLE submissions ADD COLUMN IF NOT EXISTS submission_type 
  ENUM('agency_submission', 'direct_application', 'internal_referral', 'platform_match') 
  DEFAULT 'direct_application';

ALTER TABLE submissions ADD COLUMN IF NOT EXISTS fee_structure JSONB;
ALTER TABLE submissions ADD COLUMN IF NOT EXISTS contract_terms JSONB;
ALTER TABLE submissions ADD COLUMN IF NOT EXISTS approval_status 
  ENUM('pending_agency_review', 'pending_client_approval', 'approved', 'rejected') 
  DEFAULT 'approved';

ALTER TABLE submissions ADD COLUMN IF NOT EXISTS collaboration_notes TEXT;
ALTER TABLE submissions ADD COLUMN IF NOT EXISTS client_specific_presentation JSONB;

-- Track submission performance for competitive analytics
ALTER TABLE submissions ADD COLUMN IF NOT EXISTS views_by_employer INTEGER DEFAULT 0;
ALTER TABLE submissions ADD COLUMN IF NOT EXISTS employer_rating INTEGER CHECK (employer_rating >= 1 AND employer_rating <= 5);
ALTER TABLE submissions ADD COLUMN IF NOT EXISTS agency_confidence_score INTEGER DEFAULT 50;
```

### Multi-Party Collaboration Schema
```sql
CREATE TABLE submission_collaborators (
  id UUID PRIMARY KEY DEFAULT gen_random_uuid(),
  submission_id UUID REFERENCES submissions(id) ON DELETE CASCADE,
  collaborator_org_id UUID REFERENCES organizations(id),
  collaborator_user_id UUID REFERENCES users(id),
  role ENUM('submitting_agency', 'hiring_manager', 'interviewer', 'decision_maker'),
  permissions JSONB DEFAULT '{}',
  added_at TIMESTAMPTZ DEFAULT NOW()
);

-- Track all submission-related activities for transparency
CREATE TABLE submission_activity_log (
  id UUID PRIMARY KEY DEFAULT gen_random_uuid(),
  submission_id UUID REFERENCES submissions(id) ON DELETE CASCADE,
  user_id UUID REFERENCES users(id),
  organization_id UUID REFERENCES organizations(id),
  action VARCHAR(100) NOT NULL, -- 'submitted', 'viewed', 'moved_stage', 'interview_scheduled'
  details JSONB,
  ip_address INET,
  created_at TIMESTAMPTZ DEFAULT NOW()
);
```

## Phase 2: Agency-Employer Collaboration Features

### Competitive Feature Analysis

#### What Competitors Don't Do Well
- **BountyJobs**: Transactional marketplace, not true collaboration
- **RecruiterFlow**: Agency-focused, employer experience secondary  
- **Paraform**: Elite network, excludes many good agencies
- **Greenhouse**: Enterprise-focused, poor agency collaboration

#### Our Unique Features to Build

**1. Submission Preview & Approval Workflow**
```typescript
// Before final submission, agency gets preview
interface SubmissionPreview {
  candidateProfile: CandidateProfile
  jobMatch: JobMatchAnalysis
  agencyNotes: string
  expectedTimeline: string
  feeProposal: FeeStructure
  confidenceScore: number // 1-100
}

// Employer can provide feedback before interview
interface SubmissionFeedback {
  initialInterest: 'high' | 'medium' | 'low' | 'not_a_fit'
  specificFeedback: string
  suggestedImprovements: string[]
  nextSteps: 'schedule_interview' | 'request_more_info' | 'pass'
}
```

**2. Real-Time Collaboration Dashboard**
```typescript
interface CollaborationDashboard {
  submissions: {
    pending_agency_review: Submission[]
    pending_employer_feedback: Submission[]
    active_interviews: Submission[]
    awaiting_decision: Submission[]
  }
  performance: {
    agency_success_rate: number
    avg_time_to_interview: number
    employer_satisfaction: number
  }
  communication: {
    unread_messages: number
    upcoming_deadlines: Date[]
    action_items: ActionItem[]
  }
}
```

## Phase 3: Performance Analytics & Optimization

### Competitive Intelligence Features

#### What Best-in-Class Platforms Track
**BountyJobs Analytics:**
- Agency performance scoring with historical data
- Success rates by role type and industry
- Time-to-hire metrics per agency
- Client satisfaction ratings

**Paraform Metrics:**
- 70% submission-to-interview conversion rate
- 3x faster hiring vs traditional methods
- 30% cost reduction measurement

#### Our Analytics to Implement
```sql
-- Performance metrics table for agencies and employers
CREATE TABLE collaboration_performance (
  id UUID PRIMARY KEY DEFAULT gen_random_uuid(),
  agency_id UUID REFERENCES organizations(id),
  employer_id UUID REFERENCES organizations(id),
  metric_period_start DATE,
  metric_period_end DATE,
  
  -- Submission Metrics
  total_submissions INTEGER DEFAULT 0,
  interview_conversion_rate DECIMAL(5,2),
  hire_conversion_rate DECIMAL(5,2),
  avg_time_to_interview_days INTEGER,
  avg_time_to_hire_days INTEGER,
  
  -- Quality Metrics
  avg_employer_rating DECIMAL(3,2),
  candidate_quality_score DECIMAL(5,2),
  retention_rate_90_days DECIMAL(5,2),
  
  -- Collaboration Metrics
  response_time_hours DECIMAL(8,2),
  communication_rating DECIMAL(3,2),
  process_adherence_score DECIMAL(3,2),
  
  calculated_at TIMESTAMPTZ DEFAULT NOW()
);
```

- **Time to First Response**: <24 hours (vs industry 3-5 days)
- **Agency-Employer Satisfaction**: >4.5/5 (vs typical 3.2/5 marketplace rating)
- **Process Completion Rate**: >85% (most submissions reach final decision)

### Unique KPIs for Collaboration Platform
- **Partnership Longevity**: Average agency-employer relationship duration
- **Repeat Collaboration Rate**: % of agencies working with same employers again
- **Communication Quality Score**: Based on response times and feedback quality
- **Process Efficiency**: Reduction in back-and-forth vs traditional recruiting

## Competitive Differentiation Strategy

**Our Position**: "The only platform that makes agency-employer partnerships more effective than hiring internal recruiters"

**Key Messages:**
1. **Partnership vs Marketplace**: Enhance existing relationships, don't replace them
2. **Transparency**: Full visibility into process for all parties
3. **Quality Focus**: Better outcomes through collaboration, not just speed
4. **Mutual Success**: Platform succeeds when partnerships succeed
