## NAVIGATION QUESTIONS - RESEARCH-BASED ANSWERS

### **1. What Each Tab Should Show:**

#### **"Jobs" Tab Content:**
**Platform Admin**: All jobs across all employers (marketplace oversight)
**Agency Recruiters**: Available jobs to apply for (marketplace browsing - like Paraform's "Browse")
**Employer Recruiters**: Only their organization's jobs

**Why**: Jobs tab serves different purposes:
- **Marketplace function** for agencies to find opportunities
- **Management function** for employers to track their postings
- **Administrative oversight** for platform admins

#### **"Employers" Tab Content:**
**Should show**: Contact information, relationship data, performance metrics
**Should NOT show**: Jobs directly (those are in Jobs tab)

**Why**: Research shows employers tab is for **relationship management**:
- Contact details of hiring managers
- Company information and status
- Performance metrics (time to hire, etc.)
- Communication history

**Paraform Pattern**: Separate "Clients" tab focuses on relationship management, not job browsing

#### **"Agencies" Tab Content:**
**Should show**: Agency directory with performance data
**Should NOT show**: Individual candidates (those are in Candidates tab)

**Why**: This tab is for **supplier management**:
- Agency performance metrics (placement rates, response times)
- Contact information for agency recruiters
- Success rates and quality scores
- Partnership status

### **2. Accessing Employer Jobs - Research Finding:**

**Current Issue**: "I want to see jobs for Company X but don't remember job titles"

**Solution**: **Two-level approach** based on successful platforms:
1. **"Browse/Jobs" top-level tab**: Quick job marketplace with employer filters
2. **Employer profile pages**: Deep-link to all jobs for specific employer

**Research Evidence**: Paraform uses this exact pattern:
- "Browse" tab for quick job discovery
- Employer/client pages with dedicated job sections

### **3. Contacts/People - Missing Navigation:**

**Research Finding**: Need separate **"Contacts" top-level tab**
**Why**: Recruiters think "I need to contact John at Company X"
- Individual people (hiring managers, HR contacts, agency recruiters)
- Cross-organization contact management
- Communication history and preferences

**Industry Pattern**: All successful recruiting platforms have dedicated contacts/people section

## RECOMMENDED NAVIGATION STRUCTURE (Research-Based)

### **Platform Admin Navigation:**
```
Dashboard | All Jobs | Candidates | Employers | Agencies | Contacts | Analytics
```
- **All Jobs**: Marketplace oversight across all employers
- **Employers**: Company relationship management + contact info
- **Agencies**: Supplier performance management + contact info
- **Contacts**: All individual people across all organizations

### **Agency Recruiter Navigation:**
```
Dashboard | Browse | My Jobs | Candidates | Contacts | Settings
```
- **Browse**: Job marketplace (like Paraform) - find new opportunities
- **My Jobs**: Jobs they're actively working on
- **Contacts**: Hiring managers, HR contacts, client relationships

### **Employer Recruiter Navigation:**
```
Dashboard | Jobs | Candidates | Agencies | Interviews | Settings
```
- **Jobs**: Their organization's job postings and pipeline
- **Agencies**: Supplier management and performance tracking
- **Interviews**: Dedicated interview scheduling and management

## DATA STRUCTURE IMPLICATIONS

### **Jobs Table Structure:**
```sql
Jobs:
- job_id
- employer_id (who posted it)
- status (open, closed, filled)
- assigned_agencies (who can see/apply)
- job_details (title, description, requirements)
```

**Access Logic**:
- **Platform Admin**: See all jobs
- **Agency Recruiters**: See jobs where they're in assigned_agencies OR public marketplace jobs
- **Employer Recruiters**: See jobs where employer_id = their organization

### **Contacts Table Structure:**
```sql
Contacts:
- contact_id
- organization_id
- contact_type (hiring_manager, hr_contact, agency_recruiter)
- relationship_to_user (direct_contact, referral, cold_outreach)
- communication_history
```

**Access Logic**:
- **Platform Admin**: All contacts across all organizations
- **Agency Recruiters**: Contacts they've communicated with + public contacts
- **Employer Recruiters**: Contacts within their organization + agency contacts

## PARAFORM COMPARISON - NAVIGATION DIFFERENCES

### **What Paraform Does Right:**
1. **"Browse" instead of "Jobs"** - clearer marketplace intent
2. **Secondary navigation tabs** - "Candidates, Projects, Active, Calibrations, Interview Calendar"
3. **No redundant subtitle** - clean page titles
4. **Horizontal top navigation** - good for marketplace browsing

### **What We Should Adopt:**
1. **Secondary navigation tabs** below page title (like Paraform)
2. **"Browse" terminology** for agency job marketplace
3. **Clean page titles** without explanatory subtitles
4. **Contextual secondary navigation** per page type

### **What We Should Improve:**
1. **Add "Contacts" top-level tab** (Paraform has this buried)
2. **Better role-based navigation** (Paraform is simpler, we need more sophistication)
3. **Clearer separation** between marketplace and management functions

## UI BEST PRACTICES - TITLES & SUBTITLES

### **Research Finding: When to Use Subtitles**

#### **✅ Use Subtitles When:**
- **Complex features** need explanation (e.g., "AI Matching - Configure intelligent candidate matching")
- **Ambiguous navigation** items (e.g., "Browse - Find new job opportunities")
- **First-time user guidance** for non-obvious features

#### **❌ Skip Subtitles When:**
- **Self-explanatory navigation** (like "Candidates")
- **Experienced user base** who know the workflow
- **Limited screen space** (mobile, data-dense pages)
- **Secondary navigation exists** to provide context

### **Analysis of Current Subtitle:**
**"Manage your talent pool and track candidate progress"**

**Problems**:
- ❌ **Redundant**: Users know what "Candidates" means
- ❌ **Space inefficient**: Takes valuable real estate
- ❌ **Not actionable**: Doesn't help users complete tasks
- ❌ **Against research**: Paraform and successful platforms don't use this pattern

### **Paraform's Approach:**
- **Simple page titles** without explanation
- **Secondary navigation** provides context and organization
- **More space for actual data** and functionality

## IMPLEMENTATION RECOMMENDATIONS

### **Immediate Changes:**
1. **Remove subtitle** from Candidates page
2. **Add secondary navigation** with tabs: "All Candidates | Active Applications | Interview Pipeline | Calendar"
3. **Update navigation structure** based on role research
4. **Add "Browse" tab** for agency recruiters (job marketplace)
5. **Add "Contacts" tab** for all roles

### **Navigation Updates by Role:**
- **Platform Admin**: Change "Jobs" to "All Jobs", add "Contacts"
- **Agency Recruiter**: Change "Jobs" to "Browse", add "My Jobs" 
- **Employer Recruiter**: Add "Interviews", change "Employers" to "Agencies"

### **Secondary Navigation Pattern:**
- **Candidates**: All | Active Applications | Pipeline | Calendar
- **Jobs/Browse**: All | New Opportunities | Applied | In Progress
- **Contacts**: All | Recent | By Organization | Favorites

## SUCCESS METRICS

### **Navigation Effectiveness:**
- **Task completion time**: How quickly users find what they need
- **Click depth**: Average clicks to reach information
- **Error rates**: Wrong navigation paths taken
- **User satisfaction**: Survey feedback on navigation clarity

### **Role-Based Success:**
- **Agency Recruiters**: Time to find new job opportunities
- **Employer Recruiters**: Time to review candidate pipeline
- **Platform Admins**: Time to access cross-organization data

## CONCLUSION

Research clearly shows that successful recruiting platforms use:
1. **Role-specific navigation** optimized for different workflows
2. **Marketplace-style job browsing** for agencies
3. **Relationship management focus** for employers/agencies tabs
4. **Secondary navigation** for contextual organization
5. **Clean titles without redundant explanations**

The current implementation should be updated to follow these research-based patterns for optimal user experience.
