  Framework for Next Schema Design Session

  Schema Design Framework Template:

  Section 1: Domain Analysis

  - Core Concepts: What entities exist?
  - Relationships: How do entities connect?
  - Business Rules: What constraints matter?

  Section 2: Comparative Research

  - ATS System A: How do they model this?
  - ATS System B: Different approach?
  - Industry Standards: Common patterns?

  Section 3: Proposed Design

  - Tables: Exact schema definitions
  - Relationships: Foreign keys and constraints
  - Design Decisions: Why this approach?

  Section 4: Tradeoffs & Future-Proofing

  - What We Achieve: Capabilities enabled
  - What We Miss: Limitations vs competitors
  - Easy to Add: Future enhancements
  - Hard to Change: Architectural decisions

  Section 5: Implementation Roadmap

  - MVP Phase: Minimal viable structure
  - Enhancement Phases: Incremental additions
  - Parking Lot: Fuzzy areas needing research

  
  
  
    Prompt for Duplicate Detection Schema Design

  Use this framework to design the duplicate detection schema:

  "Design database schema for candidate duplicate detection in our multi-tenant ATS system. Cover:

  Section 1: Domain analysis of duplicate detection (identity matching, privacy, cross-tenant scenarios)

  Section 2: Research how Greenhouse, Bullhorn, RecruiterFlow handle duplicates

  Section 3: Proposed schema with tables for identity fingerprinting, privacy-preserving matching, and resolution workflows

  Section 4: Tradeoffs between performance, privacy, and accuracy. What's hard to change vs easy to enhance.

  Section 5: MVP implementation (basic duplicate detection) vs advanced features (cross-tenant marketplace, AI matching)

  Focus on the database schema design - tables, relationships, and critical architectural decisions that are expensive to change later."
