## 📋 **Session Plan** - Must track/update this plan and let's score ourselves on how we are doing!

### **Morning Goals (Extended to 12pm)**
1. ✅ **COMPLETED 9:45am** - Architecture review + GitHub documentation + **CRITICAL DECISION: Contact info storage (separate table)**
2. **COMPLETED 3:15pm** - Duplicate candidate detection design ✅
   - ✅ **COMPLETED:** Created minimal schema enhancement approach (enhance existing tables vs new tables)
   - ✅ **COMPLETED:** Updated DB Schema Design Guide to prevent unnecessary table creation
   - ✅ **COMPLETED:** Separated duplicate candidates from submission conflicts  
   - ✅ **COMPLETED:** Designed composite key for candidate table (person_id, recruiter_person_id)
   - ✅ **COMPLETED:** Complete duplicate candidate detection logic at `/Users/april/10x10-Repos/claude-common/docs/Roadmap/F-DuplicateConflict/duplicate-candidate-detection-logic.md`
   - ✅ **COMPLETED:** Engineering requirements: triggers, services, indexes, constraints, testing
   
   **RESOLVED ISSUES:**
   - ✅ **UI Issue:** Multiple emails per user - need UI design to identify which email to replace
   - ✅ **Database Issue:** `changed_by_person_id` with `changed_by_table_type` for clarity
   - ✅ **Design Clarity:** Documented Duplicate (person-level) vs Representation Conflict (submission-level)
   - ✅ **Submission Flags:** Clarified `is_duplicate=true` logic with examples
   - ✅ **Array Design:** Specified JSON format for `duplicate_reason` and `detected_duplicates`
   
   **TODO - NEXT:**
   - 📋 **Submission conflict detection:** Design logic for representation conflicts (different from duplicate candidates)
   - 📋 **Review duplicate_conflict table:** Exists in current schema - used for admin resolution of duplicate candidates
   
   **EASY TODO - LATER:**
   - AI created yet another file - /Users/april/10x10-Repos/claude-common/docs/Roadmap/F-DuplicateConflict/requirements-and-current-schema.md
   - 📝 **Corner Case:** Candidate self-updating their own data (practically never happens, design for recruiter-only for now)
   
   - 📝 **Contact Type Enhancement:** Add `identifier_subtype` column to person_identifier
     - Email subtypes: Personal, Work, School, Other
     - Phone subtypes: Mobile, Home, Work, Fax, Other  
     - Social subtypes: LinkedIn, GitHub, Twitter, Portfolio, Website, Other
     - Note: Social types don't need is_primary flag
     - Database change: `ALTER TABLE person_identifier ADD COLUMN identifier_subtype VARCHAR(20)`
3. **Create DAL functions** for core operations  
4. **Test data insertion** with real examples

### **Afternoon Goals (If time permits)**  
4. **Integrate navigation** with actual data
5. **Frontend best practices** guide
6. **Performance optimization** checklist

### **Success Metrics**
- ✅ Schema deployed and working
- ✅ DAL functions tested
- ✅ Navigation shows real data
- ✅ No over-engineering or rabbit holes - Productive process. 
- ✅ **COMPLETED:** Architecture documentation created at `/Users/april/10x10-Repos/claude-common/docs/Architecture/ATS-Schema-Documentation.md`
- Good doc (easy to find and undertsnad file path/name, DRY, save ) - move research to refernece. Archive old solutions. Checkin to github.
