# ATS Database Schema - Design Decisions & Expert Fixes
## Context Document for Expert Review

**Project:** Multi-tenant ATS (Applicant Tracking System) Database Schema  
**Date:** 2025-08-13  
**Purpose:** Document all design decisions and expert-level fixes for independent review  

---

## Project Context & Requirements

### Business Requirements
We're building a multi-tenant ATS system that handles:

1. **Multi-tenant Organizations**: Recruiting agencies, employers, platform users with internal org structures
2. **Duplicate Detection**: Identify duplicate candidates across recruiters within tenant boundaries
3. **Submission Conflicts**: Handle 6-month exclusive representation when candidates are submitted to employers
4. **Prospect-to-Submission Workflow**: High-volume sourcing → qualified prospects → candidates → submissions

### Technical Context
- **Platform**: PostgreSQL + Supabase + Drizzle ORM
- **Architecture**: Single database with tenant isolation via Row-Level Security (RLS)
- **Scale**: Startup-friendly design that scales to enterprise (10M+ records)
- **Philosophy**: Application-layer business logic with database constraints as backup

### Key Business Rules
1. **6-Month Representation Window**: First recruiter to submit candidate to employer gets exclusive 6-month rights
2. **Tenant Isolation**: Agencies cannot see each other's data, employers see only their submissions
3. **Person-Based Architecture**: One canonical person record with multiple recruiter-specific candidate views
4. **Duplicate Detection**: Within tenant only - prevent agencies from seeing competitor candidates
5. **Contact Info Management**: Current truth vs submission snapshots serve different purposes

---

## Design Evolution & Key Decisions

### Original Design Issues Identified
Through expert review, we identified several startup-hostile patterns that needed fixing:

1. **Composite Primary Keys** - Created complex foreign key relationships
2. **Database Triggers for Business Logic** - Hidden complexity, difficult to test/debug
3. **Missing Performance Optimization** - No partial indexes, inefficient constraint checking
4. **Incomplete Audit Trails** - Missing created_by/updated_by fields
5. **Inconsistent ID Types** - Mix of UUID and SERIAL across tables
6. **Missing Tenant Validation** - No cross-tenant data access controls

---

## Detailed Fix-by-Fix Analysis

### Fix #1: Composite Primary Keys → Simple UUID Primary Keys

**Problem:**
```sql
-- STARTUP-HOSTILE: Complex foreign keys in child tables
CREATE TABLE candidate (
    PRIMARY KEY (person_id, recruiter_person_id)  -- Composite key
);

CREATE TABLE candidate_skill (
    -- Ugly composite foreign key requirement
    FOREIGN KEY (person_id, recruiter_person_id) REFERENCES candidate(person_id, recruiter_person_id)
);
```

**Solution:**
```sql
-- STARTUP-FRIENDLY: Simple foreign keys
CREATE TABLE candidate (
    candidate_id UUID PRIMARY KEY DEFAULT gen_random_uuid(),
    person_id UUID NOT NULL REFERENCES person(person_id),
    recruiter_person_id UUID NOT NULL REFERENCES person(person_id),
    UNIQUE(person_id, recruiter_person_id)  -- Business rule maintained via constraint
);

CREATE TABLE candidate_skill (
    candidate_id UUID NOT NULL REFERENCES candidate(candidate_id) ON DELETE CASCADE,
    skill_id INTEGER NOT NULL REFERENCES skill(skill_id)
);
```

**Why This Fix:**
- **Developer Experience**: Simple foreign keys are easier to work with in ORMs
- **Performance**: Single-column indexes are more efficient
- **Maintainability**: Debugging queries is much simpler
- **Business Rule Preserved**: UNIQUE constraint still enforces one candidate per (person, recruiter)

**Do you agree with this change?** The business rule is maintained but developer experience is much better.

---

### Fix #2: Database Triggers → Application Layer Logic

**Problem:**
```sql
-- HIDDEN COMPLEXITY: Business logic buried in database
CREATE OR REPLACE FUNCTION detect_duplicate_candidate()
RETURNS TRIGGER AS $$
BEGIN
    -- Complex duplicate detection logic here
    -- Hidden from application developers
    -- Hard to test and debug
END;
$$ LANGUAGE plpgsql;
```

**Solution:**
```sql
-- TRANSPARENT SAFETY NET: Simple constraint backup
ALTER TABLE person_identifier ADD CONSTRAINT backup_unique_active_identifier 
UNIQUE(identifier_type, identifier_value, tenant_id) WHERE status = 'active';

-- Business logic moved to application layer (documented in comments)
-- Example: async function detectDuplicates(email, phone, tenantId) { ... }
```

**Why This Fix:**
- **Testability**: Application logic can be unit tested easily
- **Debugging**: Developers can step through business logic
- **Flexibility**: Startup can change rules without database migrations
- **Performance**: Application can batch operations, use caching
- **Safety**: Database constraint catches application bugs

**Do you agree with this approach?** Business logic in application with database safety net.

### Fix #3: Performance Optimization - Partial Indexes

**Problem:**
```sql
-- INEFFICIENT: Indexes include deleted/inactive records
CREATE INDEX idx_identifier_lookup ON person_identifier(identifier_type, identifier_value);
-- This indexes ALL records including deleted ones (waste of space and performance)
```

**Solution:**
```sql
-- OPTIMIZED: Partial indexes for active records only
CREATE INDEX idx_identifier_tenant_active ON person_identifier(tenant_id, identifier_type, identifier_value) 
WHERE status = 'active';

CREATE INDEX idx_person_active ON person(tenant_id, person_type) 
WHERE deleted_at IS NULL;
```

**Why This Fix:**
- **Index Size**: 50-80% smaller indexes (only active records)
- **Query Performance**: Faster lookups for most common queries
- **Maintenance**: Less index bloat over time
- **Cost**: Lower storage and memory usage

**Do you agree with partial indexing strategy?** Significant performance gains for active record queries.

### Fix #4: Complete Audit Trail Implementation

**Problem:**
```sql
-- INCOMPLETE AUDIT: Missing who updated records
CREATE TABLE person (
    created_at TIMESTAMP DEFAULT NOW(),
    created_by UUID,
    -- Missing: updated_by, proper audit trail
);
```

**Solution:**
```sql
-- COMPLETE AUDIT: Full change tracking
CREATE TABLE person (
    created_at TIMESTAMP DEFAULT NOW(),
    updated_at TIMESTAMP DEFAULT NOW(),
    deleted_at TIMESTAMP,
    created_by UUID,
    updated_by UUID  -- WHO made each change
);
```

**Why This Fix:**
- **Compliance**: Many businesses require complete audit trails
- **Debugging**: Know who changed what when
- **Security**: Track unauthorized changes
- **Support**: Help customers understand data changes

**Do you agree with complete audit trails?** Essential for business applications.

### Fix #5: Consistent UUID Primary Keys

**Problem:**
```sql
-- INCONSISTENT: Mix of ID types causes confusion
CREATE TABLE organization (
    organization_id SERIAL PRIMARY KEY  -- Integer
);
CREATE TABLE person (
    person_id UUID PRIMARY KEY  -- UUID
);
```

**Solution:**
```sql
-- CONSISTENT: UUID everywhere for global uniqueness
CREATE TABLE organization (
    organization_id UUID PRIMARY KEY DEFAULT gen_random_uuid()
);
CREATE TABLE person (
    person_id UUID PRIMARY KEY DEFAULT gen_random_uuid()
);
```

**Why This Fix:**
- **Consistency**: One pattern across entire schema
- **Global Uniqueness**: UUIDs work across distributed systems
- **Security**: No sequential ID enumeration attacks
- **Future-Proof**: Easier to split databases later if needed

**Do you agree with UUID consistency?** Better for distributed systems and security.

---

### Fix #6: Tenant Isolation Validation

**Problem:**
```sql
-- SECURITY HOLE: No validation that user assignments stay within tenant
CREATE TABLE user_organization_assignment (
    user_id INTEGER REFERENCES users(id),
    organization_id INTEGER REFERENCES organization(organization_id),
    role_id INTEGER REFERENCES role(role_id)
    -- Missing: tenant boundary validation
);
```

**Solution:**
```sql
-- SECURE: Cross-tenant validation constraint
CREATE TABLE user_organization_assignment (
    user_id INTEGER REFERENCES users(id),
    organization_id UUID REFERENCES organization(organization_id),
    role_id UUID REFERENCES role(role_id),
    
    -- CRITICAL SECURITY: Ensure org and role belong to same tenant
    CONSTRAINT assignment_tenant_isolation CHECK (
        EXISTS (
            SELECT 1 FROM organization o, role r 
            WHERE o.organization_id = user_organization_assignment.organization_id 
            AND r.role_id = user_organization_assignment.role_id 
            AND o.tenant_id = r.tenant_id
        )
    )
);
```

**Why This Fix:**
- **Security**: Prevents accidental cross-tenant data access
- **Data Integrity**: Ensures business rules are enforced at database level
- **Compliance**: Multi-tenant applications must guarantee data isolation

**Do you agree with tenant validation constraints?** Critical for multi-tenant security.

### Fix #7: Proper CASCADE Rules for Data Relationships

**Problem:**
```sql
-- UNCLEAR: What happens when parent records are deleted?
CREATE TABLE candidate (
    person_id UUID REFERENCES person(person_id)  -- No CASCADE rule specified
);
```

**Solution:**
```sql
-- EXPLICIT: Clear data relationship rules
CREATE TABLE candidate (
    person_id UUID REFERENCES person(person_id) ON DELETE CASCADE,        -- Delete candidate when person deleted
    recruiter_person_id UUID REFERENCES person(person_id) ON DELETE RESTRICT  -- Prevent deleting recruiter with active candidates
);

CREATE TABLE candidate_skill (
    candidate_id UUID REFERENCES candidate(candidate_id) ON DELETE CASCADE  -- Skills go with candidate
);
```

**Why This Fix:**
- **Data Integrity**: Clear rules for related data
- **Operational Safety**: Prevents orphaned records
- **Business Logic**: Matches real-world relationships
- **Performance**: Database handles cascades efficiently

**Do you agree with these CASCADE rules?** They match the business relationships.

### Fix #8: Data Ownership Clarification

**Problem:**
```sql
-- CONFUSION: Which table is "source of truth" for contact info?
-- person_identifier: Current email/phone
-- candidate_submission: Submitted email/phone
-- Are they supposed to be consistent?
```

**Solution:**
```sql
-- CLEAR SEPARATION: Different purposes, intentionally inconsistent
-- person_identifier: CURRENT contact info (changes over time)
CREATE TABLE person_identifier (
    -- AUTHORITATIVE SOURCE: Current email/phone/social identifiers
);

-- candidate_submission: SUBMISSION RECORD (what was actually sent to employer)
CREATE TABLE candidate_submission (
    -- SUBMISSION DATA: Contact info sent to employer (correctable for typos)
    submitted_email VARCHAR(255),  -- What we told employer (may differ from current)
    submitted_phone VARCHAR(50)    -- What we told employer (may differ from current)
);
```

**Why This Fix:**
- **Business Requirement**: Employer says "I want candidate with email X" - we need proof of what we submitted
- **Legal/Contractual**: Audit trail of actual submissions
- **Practical**: People change emails/phones, but submission records should show what was sent
- **Flexibility**: Recruiters can correct typos in submissions without affecting person's current contact info

**Do you agree with this data ownership model?** Essential for audit trails and business requirements.

### Fix #9: Status Fields - Intentional TBD Strategy

**Design Decision:**
```sql
-- INTENTIONAL PLACEHOLDERS: TBD fields for unfinished submission conflict design
status_TBD VARCHAR(30) DEFAULT 'submitted',  -- Status enumeration to be determined during submission conflict implementation
conflict_details_TBD JSONB,                 -- Details about submission conflicts
conflicting_submission_ids_TBD JSONB,        -- Array of conflicting submission UUIDs
```

**Why TBD Fields Are Correct:**
- **Phase-Based Development**: We completed duplicate candidate detection first
- **Next Phase**: Submission conflict detection design comes next
- **Intentional Placeholder**: TBD suffix makes it clear these need implementation
- **Schema Stability**: Fields exist but content/validation rules come later

**This is NOT a fix - this is intentional design strategy.**

**Do you agree with TBD placeholders for next phase work?** Allows schema stability while indicating unfinished business logic.

---

### Fix #10: Business Rule Validation

**Problem:**
```sql
-- MISSING: No validation that representation_expires_at makes sense
representation_expires_at TIMESTAMP  -- Could be any date, even in past
```

**Solution:**
```sql
-- VALIDATED: Business rule enforcement
representation_expires_at TIMESTAMP,

-- Constraint: Expiry must be after submission and within reasonable window
CONSTRAINT valid_representation_window CHECK (
    representation_expires_at IS NULL OR 
    representation_expires_at > submitted_at AND 
    representation_expires_at <= (submitted_at + INTERVAL '12 months')
)
```

**Why This Fix:**
- **Data Quality**: Prevents obviously wrong dates
- **Business Rule**: Enforces 6-12 month representation window
- **Error Prevention**: Catches application bugs
- **Compliance**: Ensures contractual terms are met

**Do you agree with business rule validation?** Prevents data quality issues.
