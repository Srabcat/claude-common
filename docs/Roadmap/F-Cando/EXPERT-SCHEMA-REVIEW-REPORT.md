- Performance-optimized partial indexes

### âœ… Prospect-to-Submission Workflow - EXCELLENT
**Strengths:**
- Clear progression: prospect â†’ person â†’ candidate â†’ submission
- High-volume sourcing isolation
- Conversion tracking and analytics support
- Finite state machine for outreach status

**Critical Fixes Applied:**
- Added conversion tracking from prospect to person
- Documented workflow transitions
- Performance indexes for large-scale operations

## Performance & Scalability Assessment

### ðŸŸ¢ PERFORMANCE: OPTIMIZED
**Applied Optimizations:**
1. **Partial Indexes** - Active records only to reduce index bloat
2. **Tenant-Aware Queries** - All indexes include tenant_id first
3. **Cascade Optimization** - Proper DELETE CASCADE for child tables
4. **State-Based Indexing** - Indexes on status fields for fast filtering

**Scalability Recommendations:**
- âœ… **Implemented:** Partial indexes for active records
- âœ… **Implemented:** Tenant-first index strategy  
- ðŸ“‹ **Future:** Table partitioning by tenant_id (>10M records)
- ðŸ“‹ **Future:** Separate full-text search service

### ðŸŸ¢ DATA INTEGRITY: BULLETPROOF
**Applied Safeguards:**
1. **Complete Audit Trails** - All tables have created_by/updated_by
2. **Foreign Key Constraints** - Proper CASCADE/RESTRICT rules
3. **Business Rule Validation** - Database constraints as backup
4. **Tenant Isolation** - Cross-tenant validation constraints

**Security Enhancements:**
- âœ… **Implemented:** Row-Level Security policies ready
- âœ… **Implemented:** Tenant isolation validation
- âœ… **Implemented:** Complete audit logging
- âœ… **Implemented:** Soft deletes for data preservation

## Business Logic Validation

### ðŸŸ¢ DUPLICATE DETECTION: PRODUCTION READY
**Requirements Coverage:**
1. âœ… Detect and maintain one canonical record per candidate
2. âœ… Track every candidate to canonical candidate across agencies  
3. âœ… Admin visibility into all duplicate candidates within tenant
4. âœ… Detect duplicates when new candidate added or identifier changed
5. âœ… Keep history of identifier changes with status tracking
6. âœ… Time-bound exclusive representation (6-month window)

**Implementation Strategy:**
- **Application Layer:** Business logic, conflict resolution, user experience
- **Database Layer:** Constraints as backup safety net
- **Performance:** Optimized for high-volume duplicate checking

### ðŸŸ¢ SUBMISSION CONFLICTS: COMPREHENSIVE
**Conflict Resolution Features:**
- Real-time conflict detection at submission
- Admin override capabilities with audit trail
- Flexible status enumeration for implementation
- Historical snapshot preservation for legal/contractual needs

---

## Critical Design Decisions Validated

### âœ… Startup-Friendly Patterns
1. **Simple UUID Primary Keys** - No composite foreign key complexity
2. **Application-Layer Logic** - Easy to test, debug, and modify  
3. **Flexible Status Fields** - status_TBD allows implementation flexibility
4. **Clear Documentation** - Self-documenting schema with business context

### âœ… Enterprise-Scale Patterns  
1. **Multi-Tenant Security** - RLS + tenant isolation validation
2. **Performance Optimization** - Partial indexes, tenant-aware queries
3. **Data Integrity** - Complete audit trails, cascade rules
4. **Scalability Prep** - Partition-ready design, index optimization

### âœ… Business-Critical Features
1. **Data Ownership Clarity** - person_identifier vs candidate_submission
2. **Conflict Resolution** - Admin tools, audit trails, override capability
3. **Workflow Support** - Prospect â†’ submission pipeline  
4. **Compliance Ready** - Audit trails, soft deletes, historical preservation
