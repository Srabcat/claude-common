 This is a severely critical aspect of the application and for every file changed you need to thoroughly review all the possible places that change can impact and scrutinize it to make sure we don't make any unintended changes or break any functionality that we don't want to.  

For every file changed, look at all the other parts of the code that interact with it to make sure that we haven't broken anything unintentionally.  

Need to ultrathink ultrahard while executing this plan.  

After you are done with one phase of the plan, we'll have a checkpoint where you need to ask me for my review. After I approve, you will commit the work in that phase.
