# /checkpoint [name] - Save Progress Checkpoint

**CHECKPOINT SAVED** - Current work committed to github with descriptive name.

## Usage
```bash
/checkpoint auth-login     # Saves "checkpoint: auth-login working"
/checkpoint data-display   # Saves "checkpoint: data-display working" 
/checkpoint basic-crud     # Saves "checkpoint: basic-crud working"
```

## What This Does
1. **Stage all changes**: `git add .`
2. **Commit with pattern**: `git commit -m "checkpoint: [name] working"`
3. **Continue development** - stay in current mode (prototype vs pr-ready)

## Checkpoint Strategy
- **Small, testable pieces** - each checkpoint = one working sub-feature
- **Descriptive names** - what specific functionality works now
- **Frequent saves** - don't lose work, easy rollback

## View Checkpoints
```bash
git log --oneline --grep="checkpoint:"
```

**Progress saved. Keep building.**
