1. Supabase Migration: Designing for "Pluggable" Authentication
Your concern about migrating away from Supabase is a sign of mature architectural thinking. The design I proposed is already 90% of the way there. Hereâ€™s how we make it fully "pluggable."
The Strategy: The "Auth Bridge" Pattern
We will treat our users table not as a user table in the traditional sense, but as an "auth bridge." Its only job is to connect our internal persons record to whatever authentication provider we are currently using.
Revised users Table Schema:
SQL
CREATE TABLE users (
    id UUID PRIMARY KEY DEFAULT gen_random_uuid(), -- Our internal, permanent user ID.
    person_id UUID NOT NULL UNIQUE REFERENCES persons(id),

    -- The "Auth Bridge" columns
    auth_provider VARCHAR(50) NOT NULL DEFAULT 'supabase', -- e.g., 'supabase', 'auth0', 'internal'
    auth_provider_user_id TEXT NOT NULL, -- Stores the user ID from the external provider.

    -- This ensures we can't have the same external user linked twice.
    UNIQUE (auth_provider, auth_provider_user_id)
);
How this makes migration easy:
To Migrate Away from Supabase: Let's say you move to a new provider called "Auth0."
You run a script to export users from Supabase and import them into Auth0.
You run a single UPDATE query on your users table: UPDATE users SET auth_provider = 'auth0', auth_provider_user_id = 'new_auth0_id' WHERE auth_provider_user_id = 'old_supabase_id';
You update your application's login logic to call the Auth0 SDK instead of the Supabase SDK.
To Bring Authentication In-House:
You build your own password tables.
You run a script to migrate users.
You update your users table: UPDATE users SET auth_provider = 'internal', ...
Your core business logic (person_id, organization_members, etc.) is completely unaffected. It remains linked to your stable, internal users.id. This design treats the authentication provider as a swappable component, which is exactly what you want.
